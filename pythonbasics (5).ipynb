        "  - Python is a **highlevel**(i.e, Python is closer to human language and abstracted from how computers actually work (like 0s and 1s)). It is an **interpreted programming language**(i.e, Python doesn’t need to be compiled before it runs. It’s executed line-by-line by an interpreter.This makes it easy to test, debug, and write code quickly). It is known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It was created by* Guido van Rossum* and released in 1991.\n",

        " - An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line. Unlike compiled languages (like C or Java), which are first converted into machine code using a compiler, Python uses an interpreter to directly execute the code. This makes development and testing faster, but sometimes a bit slower in performance compared to compiled languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "  - Keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meanings and serve specific purposes in the language syntax. Python keywords cannot be used as the names of variables, functions, and classes or any other identifier.\n",
        "  Let's categorize all keywords based on context and understand each with help of example.\n",

        "\n",
        "  - No, Python does not allow keywords to be used as variable names.\n",
        "Using a keyword as a variable will cause a SyntaxError, because Python expects that keyword to perform its predefined function.\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "  - Mutability refers to whether the content of an object can be changed after it is created.\n",
        "    ✅ Mutable objects: Can be changed (e.g., list, dictionary, set).\n",
        "\n",
        "    ❌ Immutable objects: Cannot be changed (e.g., tuple, string, integer).\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "\n",
        "  - This design in Python is intentional:\n",
        "\n",
        "    -Lists are mutable\n",
        "\n",
        "    Lists are used when you need to store and update collections of items.\n",

        "\n",
        "    -Tuples are immutable\n",
        "\n",
        "     Tuples are used when you want to protect data from being changed.\n",
        "\n",
        "     They are faster and more memory-efficient than lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Example use cases: fixed data like coordinates, database keys, etc.\n",

        "     \"Mutability affects how Python stores and handles data in memory.”\n",
        "\n",
        "     What it means:\n",
        "\n",
        "     When you create a variable in Python, it gets stored in memory (RAM).\n",
        "\n",
        "     If something is mutable (like a list), Python keeps a reference to that memory location because its content might change later.\n",
        "\n",
        "     If something is immutable (like a tuple), Python knows it will never change, so it can safely optimize how it’s stored (e.g., reuse memory, hash it, etc.).\n",

        "7. What is the difference between == and is in Python?\n",
        "  - == checks if two values are equal.\n",

        "\n",
        "    - not : Reverses the condition (True becomes False and vice versa).\n",
        "9. What is type Casting in Python?\n",
        "  - Type casting is the process of converting one data type to another, e.g., from string to integer or integer to float.\n",
        "\n",
        "     It’s useful when you’re working with data that comes in as strings (like user input or file data) and need it as numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit vs. explicit Type Casting?\n",
        "   - Implicit casting: Python automatically converts one type to another (e.g., int to float during calculations).\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Explicit casting: You manually convert the type using functions like int(), float(), or str().\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of Conditional Statements?\n",
        "\n",
        "   - Conditional statements allow a program to make decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Python executes different blocks of code depending on whether conditions are True or False.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "  - The “elif” keyword in Python, stands for “else if”. It can be used in conditional statements to check for multiple conditions. For example, if the first condition is false, it moves on to the next “elif” statement to check if that condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while Loops?\n",
        "   - for loop is used when the number of iterations is known or fixed.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - while loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - for loop works well with sequences like lists, strings, or ranges.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - while loop runs as long as the condition remains True.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - for loop is generally shorter and cleaner for definite loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - while loop provides more flexibility for indefinite or condition-based loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - for loop stops after iterating through all items in the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - while loop stops only when the condition becomes False.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - for loop used  when you know how many times to repeat.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - while loop used when you want to wait for a specific event or condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario when while loop  is better than  for loop?\n",
        "  - Use a while loop when the number of repetitions is unknown and depends on a condition being met.\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Ideal for situations like:\n",

        "        Repeating a process until an external condition changes\n",

        "\n",
        "       Keep asking the user for input until they type \"exit\".Here, you don’t know how many times the loop will run — that’s why while is more suitable than for.\n",
